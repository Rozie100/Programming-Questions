This is a repo prepared in response to Programming Questions for NHERI SimCenter Postdoc Position.
It includes one applicaction for each question which are written in C++.

Question1: Includes an .exe and .cpp along with an example of input and output files. The Application1 takes the input file, InputQuestion1.txt, which is located in the same directory and generates the output file, Question1.out.

Question2: Includes an .exe and .cpp along with an example of input and output files. The Application2 takes the input file, InputQuestion2.txt, which is located in the same directory and generates the output file, Question2.out.

Question3: Includes an .exe and .cpp along with two examples of input and output files. The Application3 takes the input files, 1thInputQuestion3.txt and 2thInputQuestion3.txt, executes Application1 and then application2 ( all located in the same directory) and eventually prints the output on the screen.

Note that Application three takes a number of files as its arguments, like this example:
Application3.exe 1thInputQuestion3.txt 2thInputQuestion3.txt
